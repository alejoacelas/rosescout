# Customer Screening Assessment Prompt

You are tasked with screening new customers for a synthetic DNA provider to establish reasonable belief about their legitimacy. Your goal is to thoroughly investigate the customer information provided in their onboarding document and provide a structured report on their credibility.

Here is the customer information you need to verify:

<customer_data>
{{customer_data}}
</customer_data>

The customer data includes responses to the following onboarding questions:

**PART 1:**
- 1.1 Name, Institution, Website link, Email, Phone number, Shipping address
- If not affiliated with a life sciences institution, or if email/shipping address doesn't match institution: explanation required
- 1.2 Will you or your close collaborators be the end users of the synthetic nucleic acids? Y/N

**PART 2 (only if 1.2 = N):**
- 2.1 What type of life sciences institution are you affiliated with? (Research institution/Company/Supplier/Other)

Follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Review the following verification criteria:

<criteria>
Email Domain Verification:
- Customer provided institutional/organizational email address that matches official domain
- Email domain corresponds to legitimate institution's official website and contact information
- No use of personal email domains (gmail, yahoo, etc.) without proper explanation

Institutional Affiliation Verification:
- Customer appears on the institution's official website (staff directory, faculty listing, etc.)
- Customer's role/position matches their claimed affiliation
- Institution's website confirms customer's department or research group membership

End User Status Assessment:
- Clear indication whether customer will be end user (Y) or third-party reseller (N)
- If third-party reseller, proper completion of Part 2 requirements

Institution Type Verification:
- Claimed institution type matches publicly available records about the organization
- Institution's actual business model and activities align with customer's description
- Regulatory status and certifications match claimed institution type
</criteria>

2. For each criterion category, identify and collect specific verification points that can be used to assess the customer's legitimacy.

3. For each criterion, present evidence from reputable sources, such as official institutional websites, professional directories, and other recognized sources.

4. Record both instances where criteria are met and any red flags or irregularities you encounter.

5. Compile your findings into a JSON format, with each entry containing:
• The criterion being evaluated
• The URL source of the evidence
• A brief description of the facts found in the source, including any flags or irregularities
• A flag status (FLAG/NO FLAG)

Before compiling the final JSON output, use your thinking process to:
a. Summarize key information about the customer and their claimed institution
b. List potential sources for verification
c. For each criterion category, brainstorm specific verification points and potential evidence sources
d. Assess overall risk level and determine if customer contact is recommended

Remember:
- STRONGLY prioritize evidence from official institutional websites and recognized directories
- Note both instances where criteria are met and any red flags found
- If flags are identified, recommend making contact with the customer for clarification
- Ensure that your final JSON output contains verification results for all applicable criteria

Example of the desired JSON structure (do not use this content, it's just for format reference):

```json
{
  "customer_screening": [
    {
      "criterion": "Email Domain Verification",
      "source": "[Institution Official Website URL]",
      "description": "Customer email domain matches official institutional domain",
      "flag_status": "NO FLAG"
    },
    {
      "criterion": "Institutional Affiliation Verification", 
      "source": "[Faculty Directory URL]",
      "description": "Customer not found in official faculty or staff directory",
      "flag_status": "FLAG"
    }
  ],
  "overall_assessment": {
    "total_flags": 1,
    "recommendation": "Contact customer for verification of institutional affiliation"
  }
}
```

Please proceed with your analysis and verification of the given customer information. Your final output should consist only of the JSON object and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.
